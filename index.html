<h2>Hy is a Lisp dialect that's embedded in Python.</h2>

<!-- This should be mirrored from `whyhy.rst` in Hy, while omitting
an etymological digression in the first sentence. -->
Hy (or "Hylang" for long) is a multi-paradigm general-purpose programming language in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">
Lisp family</a>. It's
implemented as a kind of alternative syntax for Python. Compared to
Python, Hy offers a variety of extra features, generalizations, and
syntactic simplifications, as would be expected of a Lisp. Compared to
other Lisps, Hy provides direct access to Python's built-ins and
third-party Python libraries, while allowing you to freely mix
imperative, functional, and object-oriented styles of programming.

To install the latest release of Hy, just use the command <code>pip3 install
--user hy</code>. Then you can start an interactive read-eval-print loop (REPL) with
the command <code>hy</code>, or run a Hy program with <code>hy myprogram.hy</code>.
